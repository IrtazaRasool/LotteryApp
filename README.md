# Lottery App

This Flutter app simulates a basic lottery game where the user can try their luck and check if their number matches the winning number. The winning number is pre-set to 4, and when the user taps the refresh button (floating action button), a random number between 0 and 9 is generated. The app then informs the user whether their number matches the winning number or not.
